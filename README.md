# Author

This processing code is part of my interactive installation based on Douglas Davis’ writing The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction. The author explores ideas proposed by Walter Benjamin,  such aura and authorship of art pieces. In this installation, I focus on Davis’ argument that aura maintains in the digital age with multiple authorship.
